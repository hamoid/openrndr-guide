    ## The application block
    
    The `application` block is used to setup the run-time environment of the software we are writing. This block 
    houses two other blocks: `configure` and `program`.
    
    ## The configure block
    
    The `configure` block is an optional block that is used to configure the run-time environment. Most commonly
    it is used to configure the size of the window.
    
    An example configuration that sets the window size, window resizability and title is as follows:

    The code inside the `program` block is only executed after a window has been created and a graphical context has
    been set up. This code is only executed once.

    From the code block one can install extensions using `extend`. Extensions are by default executed as often as 
    possible. The most important type of extension is the one that holds user code.
