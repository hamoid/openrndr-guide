Here we demonstrate how to use an OPENRNDR extension. The extension that we use is the `Screenshots` extension, which, when

to create screenshots of your programs. Another is `ScreenRecorder` which is used to write videos to files.

Next to the built-in extensions there isÂ [ORX](https://github.com/openrndr/orx), an extensive repository of provided and
contributed OPENRNDR extensions and add-ons. If you work from `openrndr-template` you can easily add and remove extensions 
from your project by editing the `orxFeatures` property in `build.gradle.kts`.
